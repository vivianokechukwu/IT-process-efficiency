<h1>IT Process Efficiency With COBIT</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
I led a project to improve a manufacturing company’s IT Change Management process using the COBIT 2019 framework. By assessing maturity levels, mapping workflows, and addressing gaps such as poor documentation, weak approvals, and lack of risk assessment, I developed a phased roadmap for process improvement. Within three months, Phase 1 changes reduced unplanned outages by 40% and established a Change Advisory Board with formalized approvals, setting the foundation for automation and long-term process maturity.

<h2>Challenge</h2>
A manufacturing company faced recurring IT service disruptions due to ineffective change management practices. Unplanned outages, poor documentation, and inconsistent approvals were causing delays, business impact, and reduced confidence in IT.

<h2>Approach</h2>
I applied the COBIT 2019 framework (BAI06 – Manage Changes) to assess the maturity of the process. The assessment rated Change Management at Level 1 (Performed), highlighting gaps in risk assessment, ownership, and control mechanisms.

I developed a three-phase improvement roadmap to elevate the process maturity:

- **Stabilize (Level 2):** Formalize policies, assign a Change Manager, establish a Change Advisory Board (CAB), and enforce ticketing-based approvals.<br>
- **Establish (Level 3):** Introduce automated risk assessments, enforce testing and rollback planning, track KPIs, and improve communication with business units.<br>
- **Optimize (Level 4+):** Embed controls into DevOps pipelines, automate low-risk changes, and apply continuous improvement based on metrics and reviews.

<h2>Outcome </h2>
Phase 1 changes were implemented within three months, reducing unplanned outages by 40% and improving audit readiness. The CAB and ticketing system are now standard practice, and the organization is preparing to advance toward automation and DevOps integration to achieve long-term efficiency gains.
