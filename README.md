<h1>Strengthening Change Management in Manufacturing</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
I led a project to improve a manufacturing company’s IT Change Management process using the COBIT 2019 framework. The company faced recurring service disruptions due to ineffective practices, unplanned outages, poor documentation, and inconsistent approvals were undermining IT reliability.

<h2>Approach</h2>
I applied the COBIT 2019 framework (BAI06 – Manage Changes) to assess the maturity of the process. The assessment rated Change Management at Level 1 (Performed), highlighting gaps in risk assessment, ownership, and control mechanisms.

I developed a three-phase improvement roadmap to elevate the process maturity:

- **Stabilize (Level 2):** Formalize policies, assign a Change Manager, establish a Change Advisory Board (CAB), and enforce ticketing-based approvals.<br>
- **Establish (Level 3):** Introduce automated risk assessments, enforce testing and rollback planning, track KPIs, and improve communication with business units.<br>
- **Optimize (Level 4+):** Integrate controls into DevOps pipelines, automate low-risk changes, and apply continuous improvement based on metrics and reviews.

<h2>Outcome </h2>
Within three months, Phase 1 changes reduced unplanned outages by 40% and improved audit readiness. A CAB and formal ticketing system were established as standard practice, laying the foundation for automation and long-term maturity.
